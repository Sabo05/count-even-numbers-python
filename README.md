Hello everyone, this is my first "project" and actual code in Python (I googled the one with the heart code:))) )
I'm a 19 y/o chinese student in Italy, studying computer science, in my fourth year of highschool at ITIS A.Meucci in Florence, Tuscany.

So I actually started very recently with Python and still on my way of learning this programming language
I hope everyone can enjoy these code of mine that are already been uploaded and the future "projects" that
I will be able to learn and do on my way of becoming a pro programmer with Python thanks.
